Story 5
包公即包拯，字希仁。包公少年时便以孝而闻名，性直敦厚。在宋仁宗天圣五年，即公元1027年中了进士，当时28岁。
Bao Gong,also known as Bao Zheng,styled Xiren,was a man known for his filial piety and upright character.In the fifth year of the Tianan Sheng era during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty,in the year 1027,at the age of 28,Bao Gong passed the imperial examination and became a jinshi,a successful candidate in the highest level of the civil service examination.
先任大理寺评事，后来出任建昌(今江西永修)知县，
He was initially appointed as an evaluator in the Dali Temple and later became the magistrate of Jianchang(present-day Yongxiu,Jiangxi).
因为父母年老不愿随他到他乡去，包公便马上辞去了官职，回家照顾父母。他的孝心受到了官吏们的叫口称颂。
However,because his elderly parents were unwilling to accompany him to a distant place,Bao Gong immediately resigned from his official position and returned home to take care of his parents.His filial piety received praise and admiration from officials and the public alike.
几年后，父母相继辞世，包公这才重新踏入仕途。
Several years later,after the passing of his parents,Bao Gong resumed his official career.
这也是在乡亲们的苦苦劝说下才去的。在封建社会，如果父母只有一个儿子，那么这个儿子不能扔下母不管，只顾自己去外地做官。这是违背封建法律规定的。一般情况下，父母为了儿子的前程，都会跟随去的。或者儿子和本家族的其他人规劝。父母不愿意随儿子去做官的地方养老，这在封建时代是很少见的，因为这意味着儿子要遵守封建礼教的约束--辞去官职照料自己。历史书上并没有说明具体原因，可能是父母有病，无法承受路上的颠簸包公这才辞去了官职。
This decision was made only after persistent persuasion from his fellow villagers.In feudal society,if a family had only one son,that son could not abandon his mother and only think of his own career as an official in a distant place.This was against the feudal laws and regulations.In most cases,parents would follow their son for the sake of his future prospects,or the son and other members of the family would persuade them to do so.It was rare for parents to refuse to accompany their son to the place where he served as an official because it meant that the son had to abide by the constraints of feudal ethics and resign from his official position to take care of them.The specific reasons are not mentioned in historical records,but it is possible that the parents were ill and unable to endure the hardships of the journey,leading Bao Gong to resign from his official position.
